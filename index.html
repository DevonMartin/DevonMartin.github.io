                <p>This website was entirely built and is actively maintained by me! It serves as a portfolio, as well as a hobby. I'm much more comfortable working on back-end projects, rather than doing full-stack web development. However, I appreciate having a varied skillset and am open to working on web development if an opportunity is ever presented to me.</p>
